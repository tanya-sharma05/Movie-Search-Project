# Movie-Search-Project

Developed a dynamic movie search web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, integrating with the Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data in real-time.

Implemented filtering functionality with genre-based selection using event listeners, DOM manipulation and API URL handling.

Designed an interactive UI with overlays and embedded YouTube trailers using DOM manipulation, API-driven content loading and navigation controls.

Applied key JavaScript concepts such as fetch API, asynchronous data handling with Promises, event delegation, conditional rendering, dynamic class manipulation and modular function structuring for maintainability.
